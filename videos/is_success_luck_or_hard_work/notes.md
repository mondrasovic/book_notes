## Egocentric bias

* `Egocentric bias` describes how **people overestimate** the **amount of work they do**, i.e., their **contribution**.
  * During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, there was a poll in which men were asked **who does most of the homeschooling**, and around $50$\% of them responded that it is the men. However, only $3$\% of women agreed.
  * One study asked authors of multi-author scientific papers about the amount of their contribution and the sum always significantly exceeded $100$\% (on average it was $140$\%).
  * In another study couples were asked about how much housework they do. Again, the total consistently exceeded $100$\%.
    * The reason is not that they want to appear more helpful than they actually are. In fact, when the couples were asked about the individual contribution to problems in their relationship, they also overestimated their influence.
    * People think they do more of the work, but they also cause more problems.
* We **vividly remember what we do** thanks to direct experience but **not what everyone else does**.

## Luck in our lives

* The **egocentric bias** may lead us to similarly **underestimate** other factors in our lives, specifically **luck**.
* Asking top **NHL** players about how they have become so successful always produces responses like "hard work", "getting up early", "discipline", and so on. However, no one certainly mentions the fact that they were born in January.
  * Early birthday can make you as much as four times more likely to be a successful hockey player. The reason is that the cutoff date is the 1st of January, thus, these children are often bigger, faster, and stronger. As a result, more attention is devoted to them simply because they appear as prospective new talents. These advantages accumulate over the years.
    * We are largely oblivious to the fortunate events that support our success.
* Half of the **variance in income** is **explained** by the country of residence.
