# What Happens If a Star Explodes Near Earth?

## Key Concepts

* Stars are usually **stable** and they **fuse lighter elements into heavier ones** whilist converting a small amount of matter into energy.
* **Gravity compresses** the star, but this force is counteracted by the **pressure** generated by the **movement of particles** inside the star as well as by the **pressure of photos** released by fusion.

## Trivia
 
* If our Sun had **eight times** its mass, then it would go supernova at the end of its life.
  * What would it look like? If you put a hydrogen bomb right in front of your face and detonated the explosion would still be billion times less bright than that of supernova.
* **8. 10. 1604** - **Johannes Kepler** observed a supernova (he published it in his book called **Stella Nova**).
  * It was bright enough to cast a shadow.
