# The Alignment Problem - Brian Christian
## Chapter 1: "*Representation*"

### Problems with data

* **Lack of diversity**.
  * An example of `class imbalance` problem.
  * `Labeled Faces in the Wild` (`LFW`) dataset contains $77\%$ males, and more than $83\%$ white people. It contains more pictures of George W. Bush than all the black females combined.
* **Easy dissemination**.
  * Any inherent bias becomes pervasive.
* `Shirley Card` - Shirley Page, a Kodak employee, was the first person to pose for the `color-balance benchmark` test picture.
  * Dataset is the *Shirley Card* of some machine learning models.
* At the beginning, photos of black people were not of good quality due to not paying attention to proper calibration.
  * It changed in the 60s and 70s when the furniture and chocolate industries focused on improving their pictures.
  * In the 90s the marketing was "*dark horse in low light*".
* Contrary to popular belief, many big tech companies and banks move glacially. Thus, if their models are trained on biased datasets, it becomes very problematic to change them down the road.

### Embeddings

* Unlike the `Bag-of-Words` (`BOW`) approach, i.e., word counting, embeddings are `distributed representations` that do not suffer from the `curse of dimensionality` as much. In a BOW approach, every word is the "same distance away" from others.
* **Training**.
  * `Contextual Bag-of-Words` (`CBOW`) - given a context, predict the middle word.
  * `Skip Grams` - given the middle word, predict a context.
* A useful tool to monitor society, both in retrospective and prospective ways (a "*big brother*").
* **Bias reinforcement**.
  * ResumÃ© screening. The built-in bias reinforces who gets hired, thereby producing more biased data for subsequent model training.
* **De-biasing**.
  * It is like putting "*lipstick on a pig.*"
  * `Principal Component Analysis` (`PCA`) was used to find the dimension that explained the greatest amount of variation between word pairs such as "*male*" and "*female*", or "*kind*" and "*queen*". The assumption was that the *gender* was responsible.
  * Removal of problematic relationships does not work.
    * In 1952, Boston Symphony Orchestra began holding its auditions with a screen placed between the performer and the judge. Others followed suit in the 70s and 80s. However, they also had to instruct the candidates to remove their shoes before walking onto the wooden floor of the audition hall.
      * "*Machine learning models can hear the shoes!*"


## Chapter 2: "*Fairness*"

* `COMPAS` - Correctional Offender Profiling for Alternative Sanctions.
  * A **linear model** based on a weighted average of features like age, age of the first arrest, criminal history, etc.
  * Its **prediction** was whether the defendant would re-offend within $1$-$3$ years.
  * `Exploratory data analysis` revealed that for black defendants, the distribution of re-offense scores was pretty uniform, whereas, in the case of white defendants, it was substantially skewed towards low-risk values.
  * `Calibration` was meant to assure that risk scores indicated equal probabilities of re-offending regardless of the race, which was shown to be correct.
    * Even though calibration is generally desirable, it provides little guarantee that decisions are equitable.
  * **Inherent flaw** in predictions was this. The model was $61$\% accurate. When its prediction was correct, race did not play a role. However, when the model was wrong, it was wrong in strikingly different ways for different races.
    * Black defendants were twice as likely to be rated as a higher risk but not re-offend. And white defendants were twice as likely to be charged with new crimes after being classed as lower risk.
* `Differential privacy` (**DP**) - A concept that allows companies to collect data about a population of users while maintaining the privacy of the individual users themselves.
  * It is a system for publicly sharing information about a dataset by describing the patterns of groups within the dataset while withholding information about individuals in the dataset.
  * Learn nothing about an individual while learning a lot about a population.
* `Redundant encoding` - When an attribute is **strongly correlated** with **other** attributes.
  * Thinking that removing an attribute indicating a race group will prevent a model from being discriminatory toward a particular group is flawed due to redundant encoding.
  * Simply omitting the `protected attribute` makes it impossible not only to measure the bias but also to mitigate it.
* **Cambridge Analytica** (**CA**) has been suspected of directly influencing political campaigns.
  * In $2016$, Donald Trump's campaign was supported by the work of CA.
    * The approach seemed innocuous at first. Roughly $300\ 000$ people received a survey in which they used a scale from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree" they were supposed to indicate their preference (or lack thereof) regarding various personality traits. Moreover, they were paid less than $5$\$. However, a requirement was to log in with their Facebook account. Thus, their location, name, liked pages and everything else were exploited in conjunction with their questionnaire response.
* **Equalizing** `False Positive Rates` **(**`FPR`**)** - There is a **threat of asymmetry**. The issue is that once there is an endeavor to equalize FPR in a risk-assessment context, i.e., ensuring that defendants who won't re-offend are no more likely to be improperly detained whether they are black or white, would entail different standards as long as the actual offense rates between the two groups are different.
* Crime generally occurs within the community, not between communities.
* One of the most important things in any prediction is to make sure that you're actually predicting what you think you are.
  * In the context of criminal behavior. Does the data actually capture reoffense or is it rather rearrest or reconviction? The data shows samples of criminal behavior that were punished, not the ones that evaded capture.
  * These models are trained to predict crime that becomes known to the police. In other words, they are predicting policing, not a crime.
  * Criminals who manage to evade getting caught will be treated as low-risk, thereby influencing the models so that similar people would get released on the basis of such a prediction trained using biased data.
  * There is a threat of a potential **long-term feedback loop**.
  * In this setting, `selection bias` meets `confirmation bias`.
    * The system begins to sculpt the very reality it is meant to predict in the first place.
    * There is an old adage **Use Only As Directed**.
    * Imagine a model which predicts that the most reckless drivers are male. As a result, the police start aggressively pulling over male drivers. At the same time, female drivers realize they are less likely to be reprimanded or even punished with a fine, therefore, they become even more careless.
* Predictions are not an end in themselves. You should not predict just to predict.
  * What is better. A world in which we are $99$\% sure when and where a crime will happen, or where there is $99$\% less crime in general?
* One of the fundamental assumptions of machine learning practice is that your training data matches the distribution of your test data. However, this flatly contravenes many common use cases in which there is an attempt to intervene with the future and change it.
